Hi there,

Welcome to the hub where I publish my essays about different topics on Business and System Analysis. Also here I touch on such a subject as Product Ownership as it is the direction my career is developing at the moment.

Writing an essay is an approach to streamline the experience, some self-reflection, and segmentary pieces of information into something structured. Making it public is a way to improve the quality of text and to discipline me as now I commit to a Reader.

I enjoy public speaking but writing provides a possibility to deepen into details which might be problematic if you broadcast to a wider audience. I am taking an opportunity to revise those speeches by exploring some specifics more precisely.

So let us get acquainted. My name is Ilya and here are some facts related to my career path: 

* While being in the University tried to launch a website to sell women clothes with my friend. With no business plan, we spent money on the development and photos with models wearing those clothes. So nothing was left for any kind of marketing and promotion. That was a huge fail, but that experience led to the IT industry.

* Started career back in 2014 as an L1 Support Engineer in 24/7 Tech Support. Spent all my free time learning Python, HTML/CSS, JS, and databases, trying to develop some pet projects.

* Switched to a Business Analyst position in 2016. My first projects in that role were related to MS SharePoint. At some point, I really thought about becoming a SharePoint consultant.

* Wanted to lead my career more into UX, but in 2018 accepted a proposition to work on rebuilding an older-than-myself backend monolith into microservices. There I got into a volatile agile environment with a hardcore system analysis in place. At some point, I started to own some product directions and acted as a proxy Product Owner.

* So I started to learn Agile methodologies and Product Ownership specifics. In 2020 I finally got a chance to switch to a PO role in the field of integration & low-code products.

Other details can be found in my LinkedIn profile.

Thanks for visiting & enjoy reading!

Best Regards,
